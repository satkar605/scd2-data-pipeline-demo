-- Task 3: SCD Type 2 Backfill for Actors History
-- ============================================================
-- This query generates full historical version tracking for actors.
-- 
-- Step-by-step breakdown:
-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate all target years from 1970 to 2021 (generate_series).
-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ For each year, pull cumulative film data up to that year.
-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate average rating and film count per actor per year.
-- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Assign quality_class based on yearly avg_rating.
-- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Mark is_active if actor had at least one film in that year.
-- 6Ô∏è‚É£ Use LAG() to compare current vs previous year's attributes.
-- 7Ô∏è‚É£ Flag any changes using change_indicator.
-- 8Ô∏è‚É£ Use SUM OVER() to generate streak_identifier for continuous unchanged periods.
-- 9Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate streaks into SCD version rows (start_year, end_year).
-- üîü Finally, insert fully versioned data into actors_history_scd table.
